# Kinexa - A LinkedIn for Teenagers 

# Idea ðŸ’¡
The Idea basically is to make a LinkedIn clone but for teenagers and people who are below 18+, the idea sparked when
I remembered the time when I struggled with game development as I was bad at art and I coudnt find anyone to help me 
out with that sector. The basic idea in the platform is people send each other collaboration letters which are known
as a 'kex', so on a kex the person can either reject or accept the offer and can start working with the person!
